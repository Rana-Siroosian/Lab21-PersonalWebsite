        <h4>History Of Computer Programming</h4>
        <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language. The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit.</p>
        <p>The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic. </p>

        <h4>My Third language Is Java</h4>
        <p>The original name for Java was Oak. Java legend has it that a big oak tree that grew outside the developer James Gosling’s window. It was eventually changed to Java by Sun’s marketing department when Sun lawyers found that there was already a computer company registered as Oak.Though many would argue that Java is all time favorite among developers, it is second most popular programming language after C.</p><p> Java is ranked #2 in popularity among programming languages, according to the programming languages popularity tracking website, tiobe.com.The JUnit Testing Framework is currently the top used Java technology. Its stability and popularity can be deduced from the fact that almost 4 out of 5 Java developers or 70 % developers out there used JUnit Testing Framework. </p>

        <h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
        <p>It requires immense dedication. I mean, forever.It requires passion. Of course you don’t have to feel passionate right now, you’re just getting started, but it has to happen somewhere down the road. Otherwise you’re going to be mercilessly left behind by those who are.It requires analytical thinking, good decision making, patience and curiosity, lots of curiosity.It requires you to be self-taught. Yes, you can learn the theory from the books, but when your code breaks, nobody is going to hold your hand.</p>
        <p>Technology is emerging at an unprecedented pace, with new coding languages created every year to keep up with this rapid innovation. Believe it or not, there are currently more than 500 programming languages, and that number continues to rise!So, here’s the million dollar question: Can someone really become a successful developer only knowing a single programming language? While there are specialized roles in single languages, including JavaScript, the majority of companies and jobs do, in fact, require knowledge of multiple programming languages.
